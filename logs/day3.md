# Day 3

### Theory

- we need to assign unique values as a key in each element of the list using key={fruit.name} to provide each element a unique id here name was unique so it was fine to use that here, but we have taken a different object 'id' to use as the key since name can have naming conflict later on.

### Tasks performed

- Rendered lists from an array of items
- Used map method to map list items
- used sort method to sort alphabetically or Numerically
