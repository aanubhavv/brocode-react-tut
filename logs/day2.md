# Day 1

### Theory

- css can be applied in different ways in a react component: External, Module, Inline
- Module css styling helps to eliminate naming conflict
- Inline styling if done within the component by using javascript, in this method all the variables are camalcase and values are seperated by , and not ;
- also we do not use className for inline we will use style keyword to apply css either directly or passing a const/var that includes the styles (we have passing method in this repo)
- inline is good to use when minimal styling is required for isolated components
- inline reduces the readability of the component

### Tasks performed

- added styling in a button component using different ways.
